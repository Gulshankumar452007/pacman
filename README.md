# Pac-Man Game

Welcome to the Pac-Man game project! This simple implementation of Pac-Man is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Overview

This project features a basic Pac-Man game where you control Pac-Man using arrow keys to collect dots while avoiding a ghost. The game is designed to be simple and does not use any external images.

### Features

- **Pac-Man Movement**: Use the arrow keys to move Pac-Man around the game canvas.
- **Ghost Movement**: The ghost moves randomly on the canvas.
- **Dot Collection**: Collect dots to score points.
- **Collision Detection**: Game alerts when Pac-Man collides with the ghost or collects a dot.

### How to Play

1. **Move Pac-Man**: Use the arrow keys on your keyboard (Up, Down, Left, Right) to navigate Pac-Man.
2. **Collect Dots**: Move Pac-Man to the dot to score points. The dot will reappear in a random location after being collected.
3. **Avoid the Ghost**: Avoid colliding with the ghost. If Pac-Man and the ghost collide, the game will alert you with a "Game Over" message.
